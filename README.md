Sociodemographics of EV Owners Between 2011-2018

 Electric Vehicle sales increased on average 65% YoY. With the continual decrease in pricing, along with the availability of cheaper accessories (e.g. batteries, charging ports) and more EV models being introduced we expect growth in EV sales to continue. California by far has the most drivers of EVâ€™s (based on US sales data) and the worst pollution according to the American Lung Association makes it the best market for our research on EVs and their effects on air pollution and respiratory health. Based on demographic data for the top five California Counties based on percent of EV registrations the typical consumers currently purchasing EVs are affluent (median Income $92.6k+) and likely to be either Asian or White.

Effects EVs have on Air Quality Linear regression models showed a decrease in both ozone and PM10. R^2 values were -.3116 for PM10 and -.114 for ozone, respectively. We had negative R^2 values indicating that the linear regression model does not fit. Graph shows a decrease in median AQI with an increase in EVs per county. Again we ran into a terrible R^2 value of -.1642 showing that the model does not fit. Based on this given data and models used there is no correlation between percentage of EVs in each county of CA and air quality factors. No linear relationship.
